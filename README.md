Advent of code solutions for 2021

## Notes
Attempting timed challenges as a personal goal in JS.
Planning on making use of GitHub Copilot and Quokka JS this time for JS solutions. 

Implementations in other languages will be added as I get the time to do them.
As of now, I'm only planning on doing C#, Julia, and Python in addition to JS. A new language I plan on using this year is Java which will be in a [seperate repository](https://github.com/adhokshaja/AdeventOfCode-Java).
