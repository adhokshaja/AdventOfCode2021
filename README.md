# AdventOfCode2021
Advent of code solutions for 2021

## Notes
Attempting timed challenges as a personal goal in JS.
Planning on making use of GitHub Copilot and Quokka JS this time for JS solutions. 

Implementations in other languages will be added as I get the time to do them.
As of now, I'm only planning on doing C#, Julia, and Python in addition to JS. A new language I plan on using this year is Java which will be in a [seperate repository](https://github.com/adhokshaja/AdeventOfCode-Java).

## Puzzles
### [Day 1](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/1)
Day 1 is pretty straightforward.
- JS Solution: [Day 1](js/Day1.js)
- C# Solution: [Day 1](cs/day1.cs) - Very Optimized

### [Day 2](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/2)
Day 2 is also very straightforward.
- JS Solution: [Day 2](js/Day2.js)

### [Day 3](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/3)
Day 3 took a few mins to fully understand; but once understood is kinda easy. 
- JS Solution: [Day 3](js/Day3.js) - Brute Force, Recursive function

### [Day 4](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/4)
Screwed up parsing input, Github Copilot screwed me over and sent me down the wrong path.
- JS Solution: [Day 4](js/Day4.js)

### [Day 5](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/5)
Day 5 was a little tricky, didn't realize at first that the vents could go in either direction.
- JS Solution: [Day 5](js/Day5.js)

### [Day 6](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/6)
Day 6 is probably not as straight forward as it looks. 
- JS Solution: [Day 6](js/Day6.js)

### [Day 7](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/7)
Day 7 is where brute force works just fine, but had to spend some time with typos.
- JS Solution: [Day 7](js/Day7.js)


### [Day 8](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/8)
Day 8 is a little tricky. Spent a ton of time trying to understand the problem.
- JS Solution: [Day 8](js/Day8.js)
